					Two pectoral fins, two pelvic fins
					Pelvis not attached to spine
					Fins,
						Basal bones that attach to projections called pin rays
				
				2. Transitions
						a. Basal fin bones lengthen and develop joints
							Eventually jointed digits - Toes and fingers - Phallanges
						b. Fin rays seperate from bones, eventually disappear
						c. Skull sahpe changes
							widening skull with eyes on the top of the skull, instead of the side
						d. Pelvis attaches to the spine

			Amphibians, first tetrapods
				Skull shape, wide and eyes on top
					Limited jaw attachment space
					1 cervical vertebrate
						Leads to limited head movement due to no neeck
		Reptiles
			
			2. First fossil,
				Hylonomus, 
					Teeth, multiple cervical vertebrate

				2. Synapsid 
					Skull depression w/ one bony arch across it
					One fenestra
				3. Diapsid
					One depression
					Two arches across it
					two fenestrae

4/24
		1. Reptile jaws are made of 4 bones
			frontal - dentary
			dorsal - angular
			dorsal-top - articular
			dorsal from dentary - surangular
			
			squamosal
		compare to mammal,
			mammals have 1 bone, deuslary
		
		2. Middle ear bones
			Reptiles 1 stapes
			eardrum -> Stapes -> inner ear
			
			Compared to mammals,
				Mammals have two bones
					eardrum -> *mailous -> *incus -> stapes -> inner ear
		
		2. Transitions
			a. Angular and surangular reduced in szie
				no longer aprt of the jaw
				at least one may have disappeared
			b. Articular bone reduced, disappeares from jaw
				may end up in middle ear
			c. Only dentary bone left
			
			d. articulation point from quadrate to dentory-squamosal
				Quadrate: possibly in middle ear
		3. Early Triassic
			Morganucodou
			B. first birds

					Theropods, two big legs and two little legs ~ T-Rex
						4 legs, front-back
							Five digits on the limbs, three functional *run on three toes*
								Bipedal
							b. Hallow bones

							d. Front limbs smaller than back
							e. Long tails
							f. Jaws with sharp teeth
				2. First transition fossil of any kind, 
					Archaeopteryx

							except front limbs
						Diff from theropods	
							Front-legs are bigger
							Feathers
				3.	Theropod to Archaeopteryx
						front limbs elongated
						Evolution of feathers
							simples hairs -> tuff of hairs -> branched hairs -> feathers
				4. 	Archaeopteryx to birds 
						snout shortens
						teeth are lost
						Sternum enlarged
						keel on sternum
						Loss of vertebrate which shortens tail
						some vertebrate fuse together to lessen flexability for flying
			C. Dominant organisms on land
				1. invertebrates
					Insects
				2. vertebrates
					archosaurs; mostly dinosaurs
						primarily types:
							Ornithischia
							Saurichians->\_Pelvis structure differ
								Divided into
								Sauropods
								Theropods
				3. plants
					Seed plants, gymnosperms "Naked seed"
						Mature cones open, seeds are exposed, which fall out/spread by wind dispersal
					Cyads and Conifers
					Fossils:
						Permineralized 
							wood and cones
							seed
						Carbonized
							leaves
		IX. Cretaceous
			A. First angiosperms (flowering plants)

					Modified gymnosperm cone
					petals

							Bees, wasp, ants
						Diptera
							Flies
						Coleoptera
							Beetles
						Lepidoptera
							butterflies
				3. Plants
					Gymmosperms at beginning
					Gymmosperms and Angiosperms shared dominance
			C. Extinction
				Current evidence
					Large body hit the earth
						Dust in the atmosphere
						Lower light intensity
						Lower temperatures
					Effects
						Significant effects on 
							dinosaurs - Archosaurs, esp 
							Plants - Gymnosperms
							Birds
						Little effect on:
							Insects, angiosperms, lepidosaur reptiles

		X. Paleogene 
			Each period called EPICS, 
				Paleocene, eocene, oligocene, miocene, pleistocene+Holocene
			A. Fruits
				1. Primates ( Paleocene)
						Primates have flat nails, instead of  claws
							five functional digits on all limbs
								including grasping ability
							rotational shoulder joint
							eyes front of skull
				2. Apes (late oligocene)
				3. Hominins (Pilocene)
			B. Dom origanisms
				on land, 
					invertebrates: insects
					vertebrate: Lepidosaur reptile, mammals, birds
				Marine,
